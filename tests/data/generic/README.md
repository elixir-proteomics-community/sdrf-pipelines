## quantms_dia_dotd_sample.sdrf

This is a sample SDRF file for the quantMS-DIA workflow. Contains a single sample and is meant to test the workflow that involves file conversion.

The _converted variant of this file is the same but the sample name has already been converted to the format expected by the workflow (`.d.zip -> .d`).
